This module manages cron entries.

Unlinke the cron type, it does not require to define the exact timing of
when the cron job executes, it instead relies on run-parts and cron directories.

You can add a cron job with a predefined frequency by using the cron::entry define.
Look at the define to see the accepted parameters.
Stderr and stdout of each cron entry is redirected in /var/log/cron/... and a
logrotate definition is added to manage log rotation.

You can define a frequency by using cron::frequency define.
Once defined, you can use it as a frequency target to cron::entry.

You can have a completely custom entry using the cron::customentry define,
which uses the cron.d directory
